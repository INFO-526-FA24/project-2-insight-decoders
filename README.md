Overview
This project explores trends in the gaming industry using a dataset containing 4989 rows of data extracted from Kaggle. The primary goal is to analyze and visualize key trends, incorporating advanced data visualization techniques and introducing independently learned methods. The focus is on forecasting gaming industry metrics like revenue, daily active users (DAU), and new registrations while highlighting platform-specific and genre-based insights.

The project emphasizes actionable insights for the gaming industry by leveraging both statistical modeling (Prophet) and machine-learning techniques (XGBoost) to predict trends and provide visual storytelling.

Goals
The project aims to:

Explore historical trends in the gaming industry using interactive and static visualizations.
Incorporate an advanced R package or technique not covered in the course curriculum to enhance storytelling (e.g., the use of Prophet for seasonal forecasting).
Answer the following research questions:
How have gaming trends evolved over time?
What is the relationship between platform popularity and user ratings?
Which genres are growing in popularity?
Provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders, focusing on platform-specific growth opportunities and optimal timing for game releases.
Methods and Techniques
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Removing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Aggregating weekly data and adding lagged features.
Engineering features like moving averages and seasonal components (sine/cosine transformations).
Modeling

XGBoost: Used for feature importance analysis and revenue forecasting.
Prophet: Used for long-term forecasting and capturing seasonal trends.
Visualization

Yearly revenue trends across genres (Action, Adventure, RPG, etc.).
Platform-specific forecasts for revenue, DAU, and registrations.
Seasonal insights, highlighting spikes during holidays and major game launches.
Deliverables
Proposal

A markdown document (Proposal.qmd) summarizing project objectives, methods, and research questions.
Visualizations and Analysis

High-quality plots, charts, and dashboards illustrating trends, forecasts, and insights.
Final Report

A comprehensive analysis connecting data-driven insights with gaming industry dynamics.
Poster

A visually engaging summary of the project's findings and actionable recommendations.
