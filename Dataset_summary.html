Budget vs. Ratings: High-budget games often receive better user ratings, but some low-budget indie games have managed to achieve critical acclaim.
Potential Challenges
Data Imbalance: Some platforms and genres may have significantly more data points than others, which could skew the analysis.
Missing Data: Certain records might have incomplete information, particularly for older games or smaller studios.
Outliers: Extremely high or low user ratings and budgets may need special handling to avoid skewing the visualizations.
This detailed dataset analysis will form the foundation of our project, helping us to refine our visualizations and address the research questions effectively.
