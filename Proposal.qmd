# Introduction
The gaming industry has seen tremendous growth in recent years, driven by advancements in technology and shifting consumer preferences. This project aims to analyze key trends in the gaming sector through the lens of data visualization. By leveraging a synthetic dataset of gaming trends, we intend to provide actionable insights and demonstrate the power of advanced visualization techniques.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create compelling visualizations that explore gaming trends over time, platform popularity, and genre dynamics. Additionally, the project will incorporate a novel visualization package or technique not covered in class to further enhance the storytelling experience.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 1000 synthetic records, each representing different aspects of the gaming industry. Key features include:
- **Platform**: Gaming platform (e.g., PC, Console, Mobile)
- **Genre**: Game genre (e.g., Action, Strategy, RPG)
- **User Rating**: Ratings given by users
- **Release Year**: Year of game release

This dataset was chosen for its comprehensive coverage of various gaming trends, providing ample opportunities for insightful analysis.This dataset has been taken from kaggle 

# Research Questions
1. **Temporal Trends**: How have gaming trends evolved over the years?
2. **Platform Dynamics**: What is the relationship between platform popularity and user ratings?
3. **Genre Popularity**: Which genres are experiencing growth or decline in popularity?
